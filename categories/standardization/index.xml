      <description>Array and tensor libraries - from NumPy, TensorFlow and PyTorch to Dask, JAX, MXNet and beyond - could benefit greatly from a uniform API for creating and working with multi-dimensional arrays (a.k.a tensors), as we discussed in our previous blog post. Today we&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce a first version of our array API standard (document, repo) for review by the wider community. Getting to this point took slightly longer than we had initially announced because, well, it&amp;rsquo;s 2020 and hence nothing quite goes according to plan.</description>
